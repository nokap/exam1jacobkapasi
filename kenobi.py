#Hi class, my name is Jake! Today I am going to be teaching you about variables, arrays, if else statements, and for loopsself.

#I know that sounds like a lot of information to learn at once, especially for someone who is just starting outself.
#Despite that, I promise I will do my best to give you guys the information you needself.

#STEP 1: variables
 # A variable in math class is something that is generally unknown, like the value x, that has a value we have to find.
 # In computer science, a variable is used to make code consice, so that your page isn't filled with tons and tons of code.
#Here is our first variableself.

a = (10+10)/2  #In here we have made a 'a' equal to '=' ten plus ten in parenthesis (10+10) divded by 2 (/2)
print(a) #I type "print(a) so that when I input this program in terminal, the answer pops out"



#STEP 2: arrays

#Arrays are a list of value, they may look scary, but they are really helpful and simple to type outself.

arrexample = ['jake', 'jon', 'malachy']
#this is an example of an array. In brackets it stores separate values that can be printed out as a list.
#an array name is a variable in that it can be named absoluetly anything as long as it has brackets, and separate terms. Think of it as a list.
#When I print out this arr, what do you think is going to pop out?
print(arrexample)
# This prints out the array.
